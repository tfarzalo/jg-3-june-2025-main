Update the Additional Services section in JobDetails.tsx to match the established styling patterns used in other work order detail sections:

1. **Fix font sizing**: Change from `text-xs` to consistent `text-sm` and `text-lg` patterns
2. **Improve text hierarchy**: Use proper label/value structure like other sections
3. **Standardize value display**: Follow the same green highlighting pattern for active services
4. **Maintain consistent spacing**: Ensure margins and padding match other sections

The changes will make the Additional Services section visually consistent with the Painted Areas, Extra Charges, and other work order detail sections while preserving the green highlighting for included services.
