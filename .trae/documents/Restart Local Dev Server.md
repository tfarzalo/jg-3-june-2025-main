I will perform the following steps to get the local dev server running:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to ensure all required packages are present and up to date.
2. **Clear Vite Cache**: Run `rm -rf node_modules/.vite` to clear the Vite cache, which can resolve common startup issues as noted in `RESTART_DEV_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
3. **Start Dev Server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
4. **Verify**: Check the output to ensure the server starts successfully on port 5173 (or another available port). If there are errors, I will analyze them and apply fixes.
