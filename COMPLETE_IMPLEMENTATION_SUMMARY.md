## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Contact status didn't update to "Customer"**
- Check that "Customer" status exists in lead_statuses table
- Verify contact has a lead_id (contact must have been created from a lead)
- Check console for errors

**Q: Property not linked to contact**
- Verify property was created successfully (check properties table)
- Check that property_id was saved to contacts table
- Refresh the page to see updated status

**Q: Can't see "Create Property" button**
- Contact may already be linked to a property
- You may be in edit mode (exit edit mode)
- Check that you have proper permissions

**Q: Property group dropdown empty**
- No property groups created yet
- Create property groups first, then use this feature
- "None" option is always available

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check contact status
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, status_id, property_id 
FROM contacts WHERE id = '{contact_id}';

-- Check property was created
SELECT * FROM properties WHERE ap_name = '{contact_name}';

-- Check status IDs
SELECT * FROM lead_statuses WHERE name = 'Customer';

-- Check property groups
SELECT * FROM property_groups ORDER BY name;
```
